# Cows and bulls

Play the game or watch the computer solve it!

## Plan

### Game
Build the command line game with clean code practices. 
End goal should be - ability to play the game using CLI command after installation(or not).
eg.
`play-cb`

```
Enter the number of digits for which you'd like to play the game:
.
.
```

### Solver
Start out with bilding a brute force solver. 

In the next iteration, optimize it so that the solving time reduces.
Techniques to look for while optimizing:
1. MCTS
2. Python optimizations
