# Bulls-and-Cows-Game
This is my first ever python code. This code lets you play the "Bulls and Cows" game for a number of upto 3 digits.

## Game Rules. 

 - The computer(/opponent) decides a number with the number of digits of your choice.
 - The goal is to guess the number with the minimum number of guesses. 
 - Each guess helps you get some information about the decided number.
 - A number which is commom to both the guess and the decided number is considered to be a cow if it is in the wrong place value. 
 - If it is in the right place value, it is considered to be a bull. A guess can have multiple cows and bulls.
 - n bulls(where n is the number of digits in the decided number) imply a victory.
